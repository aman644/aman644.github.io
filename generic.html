									<h1>About Me<br />
									</h1>
									<p>I am a data science enthusiast , I love the way data reveal facts if we ask the right questions from it. I <br />developed keen interest in data science during final semester of my Masters degree in Statistics, it <br />was the same semester in which I realized the beauty of statistics and its potential to make difference <br /> in real world scenarios. My journey to become a data science enthusiast is a little peculiar in its <br /> own way. Since, I have a whole web page to spare, I will take this liberty to tell my voyage from <br /> the beginning . It was 2011 my 10th exams were over and I was expected to make a choice <br /> regarding subjects, that decision was left upon me by my parents which is partly good and partly bad. Good, <br /> because it sounds good, Indian parents respecting their ward’s choice is real good thing but it has <br /> a down side, I was a reserve and submissive guy back then with no exposure at all, I never went <br /> out of my small town, didn't had own phone nor pc to surf internet and see what the world is up to, long talk short I was living in a <br /> small box made up of the little circle I had back then. I looked around trying to figure out what is <br /> the most superior feat a man can go for, IAS the abbreviation for Indian Administrative Service <br /> stood out among all, the next thing I know I was in a state run school studying History, Political <br /> Science, Mathematics and English. Fast forward 2 years I found myself doing B.A in a not so <br /> reputed college in my city Jammu.Those years made me reconsider my career choices, I <br /> was studying something which was becoming dry day by day for me to shove down my throat, I <br /> saw my school friends studying in big cities talking about stuff which I no longer related to, I was studying things just to memorise and recall when needed, I realized I wanted to do things which I can put my thoughts into, develop something tangible, not just new perspective and thoughts.  </p>

								<p>“The most abundant thing on this planet is opinion and perspectives, what I am doing is not making me feel worth in front of my own self.”, these words echoed in my mind over and over, it ransacked me from inside. I was not clear what and how I am going to fulfill the desire of reversing my choices. I decided to go with the flow until I find what and how I am going to finally do, I went for masters in Statistics. It was not my first choice to take statistics but somehow I ended up doing it. Initially I had a hard time getting grip of the subject but eventually I gave statistics a try and started getting hold of the subject, during my masters I learnt various statistical softwares which made me see the true nature of the subject which my professors were sadly unable to deliver. After completeing my masters I got to know about data science and when I asked my professors about how to approach it they told me to learn SAS software package first, which I did but eventually I had to look towards python as most of the Data Science stuff on internet was taught using Python codes.I loved it so much that I decided to go for GATE examination and qualify that mighty exam to further my data science studies in some good institute, the result of which sadly didn’t come out as expected. After that I started studying data science from various books and internet on my own and today I am equipped with python programming skills, Data visualization tools, SPSS, SQL, Web scraping, HTML tags and much more.</p>
